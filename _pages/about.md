Our group seeks to elucidate the fundamental dynamics that govern small-scale physical-biological interactions in the coastal ocean, and their broader implications. In particular, we are interested in how vertical behavior influences transport and the ocean conditions encountered. To gain new insight, we combine in situ measurements from underwater robots and numerical experiments with particle tracking.
