### Dr. Jasen Jacobsen
*postdoctoral scholar*

Jasen's research focuses on how fluid processes in the ocean shape marine 
ecosystems, from nutrient dynamics to higher trophic levels. Using 
numerical simulations and observations, Jasen studies how physical 
processes drive changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton growth, abundance, 
and distribution to better understand how environmental variability 
influences ecosystem dynamics.
